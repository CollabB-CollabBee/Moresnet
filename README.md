# Moresnet
Collaborative multiplayer, many worlds game of life.

### The idea
Moresnet is a collaborative multiplayer, multilevel, many worlds game inspired by Conway's Game of Life adapted for right brain development. The rules may be subject to change, if and only if, this is absolutely necessary.

### The setting context:
Moresnet is an Utopian future planet where life evolves. It is created by a universal force or deity. The mesmerizing Goddess of Humor. She has set the rules of the game, the physics if you will. The goal is to cooperate as a human species and reach the global level of Armageddon. This level can only be reached and unlocked as at least one person from any  nation, nationality plays the game. At the Armageddon level, the Moresnet world or many worlds will be visited by an outer space species. The goal of the Moresnet people is to find out if the aliens are friendly, cooperative, deceitful or destructive. The Armageddon level is free for creativity and deals with the Turkey Problem.
