Moresnet
Created vrijdag 01 december 2023

### Project brief:

Moresnet is a collaborative multiplayer, multilevel, many worlds game inspired by Conway's Game of Life adapted for right brain development. The rules may be subject to change, if and only if, this is absolutely necessary.

### The in game rules:
1. You must collaborate
2. Keep an eye on others
3. Do not bump into each others
4. You may not kill, torture or use violence
5. You must develop a planet,  society etc.
6. You may have cons, villains etc
7. No human or animal sacrifices
8. You must prepare for Armageddon

### The setting context:
Moresnet is an Utopian future planet where life evolves. It is created by a universal force or deity. The mesmerizing Goddess of Humor. She has set the rules of the game, the physics if you will. The goal is to cooperate as a human species and reach the global level of Armageddon. This level can only be reached and unlocked as at least one person from any  nation, nationality plays the game. At the Armageddon level, the Moresnet world or many worlds will be visited by an outer space species. The goal of the Moresnet people is to find out if the aliens are friendly, cooperative, deceitful or destructive. The Armageddon level is free for creativity and deals with the Turkey Problem.

### The Moresnet context:
Moresnet world is a earth-like planet with one Volcano. This Volcano is the heart of the game. The Volcano must be satisfied by Moresnet people's  co-operation and collaboration. The Volcano is dormant, but wakes up if Moresnet people do not cooperate. In the initial setting life if balanced, because Moresnet people don't exists.  The Volcano produces gold and diamonds, however these are special . As long as people collaborate etc the gold and diamonds can be used for trade. But if people do not cooperate the gold and diamonds turn into mini volcanoes that must be satisfied as the big one.  With every dissatisfaction the level of the Volcano rises. If the Moresnet people can't satisfy the Volcano it erupts and wipes out all civilization. Everybody has to start over again.

Moresnet can have villains, cons etc. But there is a catch. The villain can go for the gold/diamonds in the Volcano and keep it all to him/her self, but this will angry the Volcano if not balanced out enough by cooperation.  The ultimate  price the Villain pays is that when the player is busted by the other players, the player with the gold/diamonds must return to the Volcano and becomes one with the Volcano. The Volcano will then carry the name of that player and becomes a mythical being that can not take part in the game. The player must start over without any of the accomplished things.

Each time the player starts over the allocation of resources are randomly distributed. So you can't chose strategically.

### The game development rules:

* You may use fighting etc, but then the level of the Volcano must  increase
* The game may not have cheat codes
* Any fork must have the initial basic Moresnet rules coded and respected.
* You can create as many worlds as you want, but cooperation will become  more complex, because it will give more Volcanoes to satisfy besides The Almighty Volcano. You can't get rid of this Volcano.
* The initial planet Name Moresnet is mandatory
* Villains lose their life when busted by other players and must become The Volcano
* The developers, designers are encouraged to use humor, metaphors, parables and other creative outings in order to create an exiting memorable  game

* The game should be crypto currency ready
* The game must track how many worlds are created, how many times the Moresnet World stats over, and how long for the Armageddon level.
* The game may have a private level for practice. This level has its own Volcano and the things done do not count towards The Almighty Volcano, entering the global competition means starting over.
* The level and amount of players needed for unlocking the Armageddon level is to be announced (open to suggestions)
